helppopup.credentialsairsonic.title=Airsonic credentials
helppopup.credentialsairsonic.text=Airsonic supports two primary means of its own authentication for clients. Clients can send either the password openly (<code>p</code>), or can send an md5-hash of the password along with the salt (<code>t+s</code>).<br />By default, new passwords are stored in their hashed form, which is secure, cannot be decoded to the original password (non-decodable), and works for the <code>p</code> auth mechanism.<br />For technical reasons, supporting <code>t+s</code> method, however, requires storing the decodable non-hashed password itself, which may be less secure (especially if stored in an open non-encrypted form).<br />Therefore, store Airsonic passwords in a decodable manner ONLY if your client requires <code>t+s</code> auth to work (store in encrypted manner, such as <code>encrypt</code>-style encoders).<br />It is recommended to migrate all passwords to non-decodable formats (such as <code>bcrypt</code>), and later add a decodable format only if a client does not work.<br />Airsonic credentials cannot be all deleted, otherwise the account will be locked out. You must retain at least one Airsonic credential. If all Airsonic credentials are selected to be deleted, the system will automatically retain the most recently created one.
helppopup.credentialsthirdparty.title=External third-party credentials
helppopup.credentialsthirdparty.text=These MUST be stored in a decodable format for Airsonic to be able to send to third-parties. If multiple credentials for the same third-party are specified, the system will use the one updated most recently.
helppopup.credentialslegacypasswords.title=Legacy Passwords
helppopup.credentialslegacypasswords.text=Legacy passwords are stored in a decodable "open" (non-encrypted) form.<br />You should migrate your legacy passwords to a non-decodable hashed form (more secure, but incompatible with clients needing <code>t+s</code> style auth), or confirm that you want them to be stored in a decodable form (less secure, but compatible with <code>t+s</code> style auth).<br />All credentials that have not been explicitly migrated WILL BE force-migrated to a non-decodable form (were possible) in future versions.
helppopup.credentialsencryptionkey.title=Encryption Key
helppopup.credentialsencryptionkey.text=Encrypts all the passwords using the <code>encrypt</code>-style password encoders. Changing the encryption key password will render all old passwords encrypted with the old key unreadable! New passwords will encrypt with the new key (if an <code>encrypted</code>-style encoder is chosen). Make sure you have created new creds with the new key, otherwise you may be locked out!
helppopup.credentialsjwtkey.title=JWT Key
helppopup.credentialsjwtkey.text=Signs and verifies all JWT tokens used when sharing music. Changing your JWT key will render all old Shares inaccessible.
helppopup.credentialsadd.title=Add Credentials
helppopup.credentialsadd.text=Only ADDs NEW credentials. Does NOT REMOVE OLD credentials. Removal of OLD credentials must be done explicitly in the <a href="credentialsSettings.view">Credentials Settings</a> tab
helppopup.transcodeestimatetimepadding.title=Transcode Estimate Time Padding
helppopup.transcodeestimatetimepadding.text=When transcoding, the server needs to send the final file size of the transcoded file to the client at the beginning even though the transcoding hasn\'t completed. An estimate is sent instead and is calculated by multiplying the specified average bitrate of the transcode and the duration of the source file. To guard against the case that the final transcode size exceeds this estimated size (in case the final bitrate exceeds the target average bitrate), a time padding is added to the source duration when calculating the final size. If the final transcode ends up being exactly the estimated size (a highly unlikely but best-case scenario), the stream is terminated without any issues. If the transcode is smaller than the estimate (a more likely but still preferable scenario), the server fills and sends the remaining stream with junk data until the size is satisfied. In case the final transcode exceeds the estimated size budget (a non-desirable scenario), the transcoder throws an exception and terminates immediately (since the browser won't accept any more bytes than it was originally told).
helppopup.transcodeestimatebytepadding.title=Transcode Estimate Byte Padding
helppopup.transcodeestimatebytepadding.text=Instead of adding a time pad for transcoding (as explained in the Transcode Estimate Time Padding), a flat number of bytes may also be added as a pad to guard against underestimating the final transcode size. Time padding is multiplied by the transcoded stream's bitrate and so the estimate changes as the bitrate changes. The byte padding is a constant padding regardless of the bitrate of the final transcoded stream.
helppopup.uploadsfolderpattern.title=Uploads Folder Patterns
helppopup.uploadsfolderpattern.text='An absolute path or a context-based path are both valid. Absolute paths are paths that do not vary based on user, such as <code>/var/music/incoming</code>. Contextual paths require a substitution parameter from the airsonic variables and are evaluated based on SpEL and substituted, for example <code>/var/%{[''USER_NAME'']}/incoming</code> (/var/user/incoming) or <code>%{[''USER_MUSIC_FOLDERS''][0]}/incoming</code> (the first music folder for that user + "/incoming").<p>The pattern to be substituted and evaluated must be enclosed between <i>%{</i> and <i>}</i>, example <code>%{pattern}</code> and is evaluated against a root object that contains a few context-based variables.<p>The following variables are currently available:<ul><li>AIRSONIC_HOME: Airsonic Home</li><li>DEFAULT_PLAYLIST_FOLDER: Default playlist folder</li><li>DEFAULT_MUSIC_FOLDER: Default music folder</li><li>USER_NAME: Username of the person uploading</li><li>USER_MUSIC_FOLDERS: List of paths for the user</li></ul><p>Permissions to any of the paths is not evaluated, so uploads may fail when started.'
helppopup.autobookmark.title=Auto Bookmark
helppopup.autobookmark.text=Enables auto bookmarking while media is being played. Bookmarks are generated during play (at the specified frequency), or at seek, end, or pause of the media.
helppopup.backupdb.title=Back up Database
helppopup.backupdb.text=Only works for built-in internal HSQLDB database type. Backs up to the <pre>AIRSONIC-HOME/backups/db.backup.timestamp</pre> location by copying the contents of the current active DB directory. The backup may be restored by deleting the active DB folder and replacing it with the backup folder (renaming it). Please make sure Airsonic isn't running when the DB is replaced.
helppopup.exportdb.title=Export Database
helppopup.exportdb.text=Exports a snapshot of the existing Airsonic DB. Files are in xml and are zipped. If the DB is massive, it'll take time to generate the export zip.
helppopup.importdb.title=Import Database
helppopup.importdb.text=Imports an exported snapshot of an Airsonic installation. Usually a zip file with exported xml is required. WARNING: Note that importing deletes ALL existing data in the current installation. A DB backup (if HSQLDB type) is created just in case the data import goes wrong. Also note that importing the database imports credentials of the users, but DOES NOT import the encryption keys (in airsonic.properties), which must be imported or provided separately if the credentials are expected to work. Please restart the Airsonic server after the import for the changes to take effect.
